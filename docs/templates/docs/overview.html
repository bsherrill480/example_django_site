<h1>
    Black Rabbit's Project
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    We approached this project by attempting to be RESTful with our endpoints.
    For the most part, you can expect us to follow this pattern
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Relationship_between_URL_and_HTTP_methods">
        As found on Wikipedia.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    All our endpoints are listed on our swagger. It will only list endpoints that you (the
    current user) have access to, so make sure to login as a user.
    <a href="/swagger/">You can view our swagger here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>
    Authentication can be done with a token. To get a token for a user, make a request to the
    <a href="/swagger/#/api-token-auth">api-token-auth endpoint</a> with username and password in
    the body. To make an authenticated request, include the token as a header. E.g. if your token
    is <span class="code">9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b</span>, then in your header
    you would do:
</p>
<pre>Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b</pre>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Our app is broken up into 5 main parts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#users">Users</a></li>
    <li><a href="#groups">Groups</a></li>
    <li><a href="#posts">Posts</a></li>
    <li><a href="#feed">Feed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    For the most part, our app can be understood by looking at swagger, however we'll describe
    anything we think is noteworth below.
</p>
<h3 id="users">Users</h3>
<p>
    Friendships fall under this category. We consider two users friends, if they have a "friendship"
    going both ways. For example consider user A and user B. A and B are friends if and only if
    there exist a friendship A->B and B->A. To make this more clear, in our endpoints we refer to
    this as mutual friends. You can see your mutual friends with
    <a href="/swagger/#!/api/user_friendship_mutual_read">this endpoint</a> , and your pending
    friendships at <a href="/swagger/#!/api/user_friendship_pending_list">this endpoint</a>
</p>
<h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>
Groups are a collection of people and an owner. They are used so that the owner may
make "post" to everyone in the group's feed. Moreover, only the owner of group is allowed to modify
the group and make posts, other group members don't have the access to do so.
<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>
A user can make a post and edit a post with these endpoints. When making a post, either a
group_id is passed or a user_id is passed, and that post will then appear in that user's feed.
Post only supports text content at current stage, but it could be easily extend to other type of contents.
<h3 id="feed">Feed</h3>
A feed is basically a collection of posts, it has an one to one relationship with a user.
To be more specific, a user's feed is a collection of "feeditem". When a post is created,
a feeditem is created correspondingly to connect the post and the feed.
